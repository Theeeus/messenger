# Chat App

This is a messenger app built using Socket.io, Node.js, Express and Pugjs

### User Stories

1. I can pick a nickname and choose if I want to create a new chat room or join an existing one;
2. I can't create a room with a name that's already taken or join a room that wasn't created before;
3. If I open new tabs I can create different nicknames and simulate the behavior of more than one user using the chat;
4. I get notified every time someone enters or leaves the room and get all the messages sent to the room I'm in.
